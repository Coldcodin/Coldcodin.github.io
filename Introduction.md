# Introduction

***[Science](https://www.science.org/)*** published **[125 Questions : What don't we know?](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.309.5731.78b)** in 2005.

The two questions related to genetics:

***Why Do Humans Have So Few Genes?***

***To What Extent Are Genetic Variation and Personal Health Linked?***

The Technologies we can use are **Robot** (**R**), **Nanotechnology**(**N**) and **Genetics**(**G**).

DNA & RNA : forms of genetic information

Organisms with the largest genome: **Amoeba**(670 Gbp)

*Homo sapiens*: 20000 genes, similar to *C. elegans*

Special in humans: largest percent of genome **not coding for protein** 

# Methods

**NGS** : Revolution of Sequencing Power

Big and HD data: the emergence of bioinformatics

Three steps of Bioinformatics: 

1. Information
2. Model 
3. Algorithm

**Model**: Mathematical and Probability Model, that is we use Mathematical Statistics and Probability to simulate the real world to solve our problems.

**Algorithm**: Computational Algorithm, that is we use Algorithms in Computer Science to fit the Mathematical and Probability models we design.

Information: Images and Sequences

Model: three common models

- Regression Model
- Tree Model
- Neural Network Model

Algorithms

- Number Sorting Algorithm
- Dynamic Programming Algorithm

# Plans

1. Familiar with common bioinformatic softwares (e.g. **Bash**, **R** and **Python** etc.)
2. Knowing some basic skills like coding, debugging and backing up
3. Finishing **"Bioinformatics Tutorial"**
4. Knowing the trends and emerging fields of bioinformatics
